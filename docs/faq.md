# Frequently Asked Questions

### Why do we need to supply our own OpenAI API Key?

As OpenAI charges per 1000 tokens, to avoid having to charge a subscription fee for Marker Toolbox, and keep it as a one-off payment on the Mac App Store, we have decided that if you want to use the ChatGPT features in Marker Toolbox, you'll need to supply your own API key.

You can learn more about OpenAI's pricing [here](https://openai.com/pricing).

### Does this work with any iPhone/iPad Logging Apps?

Yes, you can use third party iPhone apps, such as [Timecode+](https://apps.apple.com/app/id590534084).

Simply **Share as Text** in the Timecode+ App, then use the **Paste** button in Marker Toolbox to paste the text, and then **Process Comments Locally**.
