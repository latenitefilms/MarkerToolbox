# Frequently Asked Questions

### Why do we need to supply our own OpenAI API Key?

As OpenAI charges per 1000 tokens, to avoid having to charge a subscription fee for Marker Toolbox, and keep it as a one-off payment on the Mac App Store, we have decided that if you want to use the ChatGPT features in Marker Toolbox, you'll need to supply your own API key.
