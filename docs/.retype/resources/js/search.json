Due to limitations in Final Cut Pro's FxPlug4 API - we currently can't determine the source start timecode of a clip. Because of this, the Gyroflow Toolbox effect should only be applied to a clip where the start of the clip hasn't been trimmed in the timeline (i.e. the clip you have in the timeline should show the first frame of the source clip). If you need to trim the start of this clip, you can use the full clip within a Compound Clip, then trim the Compound Clip as required. We have been in contact with the Final Cut Pro team about this, and there's currently no other better workaround or solution.
