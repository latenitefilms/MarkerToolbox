# Marker Toolbox

Marker Toolbox allows you to import a **Vimeo** `CSV`, **Wipster** `CSV`, **Dropbox Replay** `JSON`, **Frame.io** `FIOJSON`, **Timecode+** `TSV` & **Text Comments** into Apple's [Final Cut Pro](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/), Blackmagic's [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve){target="_blank"} and [Avid Media Composer](https://www.avid.com/media-composer){target="_blank"}.

You can even get OpenAI's **ChatGPT** to help interpret your Text Comments - which is perfect for handling emails from clients!

If you're emailed a simple list of changes, you can use our powerful algorithm to transform this list into markers locally.

However, if you have a more complex email of conversational notes, you can get OpenAI's ChatGPT to help translate the email into markers!

You can even import a Clip, Multicam Clip, Compound Clip or Synchronised Clip from Final Cut Pro into Marker Toolbox, apply markers to it, and bring it back to Final Cut Pro!
