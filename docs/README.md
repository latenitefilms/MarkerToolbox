If you're emailed a simple list of changes, you can use our simple algorithm to transform this list into markers locally.

However, if you have a more complex email of changes, you can get OpenAI's ChatGPT to help translate the email into markers!

You can learn more about how it works [here](https://markertoolbox.io/how-to-use/).
