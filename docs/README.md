# Marker Toolbox

Marker Toolbox allows you to import **Vimeo** `CSV`, **Wipster** `CSV`, **Dropbox Replay** `JSON`, Frame.io `FIOJSON` & **Text Comments** into Apple's [Final Cut Pro](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/) and Blackmagic's [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve){target="_blank"}.

You can even get OpenAI's **ChatGPT** to help process your Text Comments!

If you're emailed a simple list of changes, you can use our simple algorithm to transform this list into markers locally.

However, if you have a more complex email of changes, you can get OpenAI's ChatGPT to help translate the email into markers!

You can even import a Clip, Multicam Clip, Compound Clip or Synchronised Clip from Final Cut Pro into Marker Toolbox, apply markers to it, and bring it back to Final Cut Pro!
