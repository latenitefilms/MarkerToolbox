Marker Toolbox now looks a lot nicer!","We moved the OpenAI API key into the Settings panel, and added a \"Validate\" button so that you can check that the API key is valid.","All settings are now saved between the main application and the Final Cut Pro Workflow Extension, meaning that if you change a setting in the Workflow Extension, it will also change in the main application and vice versa."]},{"i":"v120-11","l":"v1.2.0 (11)","p":["\uD83C\uDF89 Released:","22nd June 2023","\uD83E\uDD73 New Features:","The main Marker Toolbox application now shows the full user interface, so that you can use it as a standalone application - instead of just as a Final Cut Pro Workflow Extension.","Added a Save Resolve EDL button, to allow you to export comments as a Resolve EDL. Thanks for suggesting Scott Simmons!","Added a Save FCPXML button, allowing you to save a FCPXML without Final Cut Pro running.","Added ability to Apply Markers to Existing Final Cut Pro Clip. This allows you to drag in a Clip, Multicam Clip or Synchronised Clip from Final Cut Pro, apply markers to it, then send it back to Final Cut Pro. Thanks for your suggestions Iain Anderson & Kevin Luk!","We now support the Frame.io FIOJSON format, including annotations. Whilst the official Frame.io Workflow Extension does essentially do exactly the same thing as Marker Toolbox, the titles imported are basically unreadable, so Marker Toolbox corrects this. We also have slightly nicer/simpler looking arrow annotations. Marker Toolbox also seems to render annotations more correctly than the Workflow Extension in some cases (i.e. there are times when annotations seem to be missing from the Frame.io Workflow Extension). Thanks for suggesting Jeff Asher & Benjamin Evans!","Over the last week Dropbox accidentally broke JSON exporting support for Dropbox Replay, and when they fixed it, they accidentally used the \"condensed version\" (used by CSV) of the JSON. This has now been fixed on the Dropbox Replay end, however Marker Toolbox now supports this alternative JSON format, just incase it ever happens again."]},{"i":"v110-9","l":"v1.1.0 (9)","p":["\uD83C\uDF89 Released:","16th May 2023","\uD83E\uDD73 New Features:","Added Wipster CSV support.
